## Twilio ðŸ’¬
* This app requires a Twilio account, setup to post to whatever IP/port you've exposed on the server

## Redis Queue (rq) ðŸ’¬
* `rq worker` will process whatever is currently in the queue
* `rq info <default|failed>` will give information about what's currently in the queue
* `rq empty <default|failed>` will clear the specified queue

## Honcho ðŸ’¬
* honcho start will start all your services

## Create Database ðŸ’¬
 * Smack uses the Flango pattern (Flask in the front, Django in the back), as described [here](https://github.com/kennethreitz/flango) by @kennethreitz
 * The traditional `app.py` for Flask is instead `smack/frontend.py`
 * Build the DB by updating `smack/settings.py` with your database connection information, then run `python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb`

## Phonenumber Data Model ðŸ’¬
* Number: User's phone number, string, length=10 (US Only), 25 (Int'l)
 * Can't be integer because many phone numbers start with 0 (due to country codes)
 * Second pass will be to abstract out country code and phone number
* Owner: ForeignKey to Flask's User/Auth model if possible
* Muted_by: Many to Many with User
* get\_reply\_numbers: Function that returns all phone numbers, excluding your own, excluding any that you have been muted by, and excluding any that are is_active = False
* is_active: Bool default True
* is_private: Bool default True
* is_admin: Bool default False

## Message Model ðŸ’¬
 * Text: The text of the message sent, string, length=2048 (to allow for multi-part messages)
 * Sid: The delivery ID `SID` received from Twilio upon successful request, string
 * Created At: The time that the message was saved, DateTime
